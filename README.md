# python_project_001
- Create a simple python application that displays texts/images rendered from reddit.

Project Overview
- Python Application: A simple  application.
- Docker: Containerize the application.
- GitHub: Host the code and manage CI/CD.
- Terraform: Define and create the infrastructure on AWS.
- Kubernetes: Orchestrate the deployment of the containerized application.
- AWS: Cloud platform for hosting Kubernetes and other resources.

Step-by-Step Integration
1. Develop the Python Application
- Application Code: A simple script (app.py) that runs a web server (e.g., Flask).
- Dockerize: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
2. Set Up the Infrastructure with Terraform
- AWS EKS: Use Terraform to define and create an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. This will be the environment where your Dockerized application runs.
- Networking: Define necessary networking resources (VPC, subnets, etc.) for EKS.
- IAM: Set up the required IAM roles and policies for EKS.
3. Kubernetes Configuration
- Deployment and Service: Create Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files to define how your application should run and be accessible.
4. CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Build and Push Docker Image: Automate the build and push process for the Docker image to a registry (Docker Hub or AWS ECR) on every commit.
- Deploy to Kubernetes: Automate the deployment process to update the application in the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl or helm.
5. Deploying the Application
- Terraform Apply: Execute Terraform to create the AWS infrastructure and EKS cluster.
- Kubernetes Deployment: Apply the Kubernetes deployment and service configurations to deploy your application.
Importance of Each Tool
- Docker: Ensures your application runs consistently across different environments.
- GitHub: Facilitates version control and automates your deployment pipeline.
- Terraform: Provides a declarative approach to infrastructure provisioning, making your infrastructure easily reproducible and manageable as code.
- Kubernetes: Offers a robust platform for managing containerized applications, supporting scaling, load balancing, and self-healing.
- AWS: Provides the cloud infrastructure, offering scalability, reliability, and a wide range of services that integrate well with Kubernetes and Terraform.
